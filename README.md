  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My project was to refactor the API calls originally made with a RESTful API to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. This will allow our application to make numerous API fetches to one endpoint.

  I created this project in order to develop a better understanding of GraphQL and how it compares to using a RESTful API.

  Someone will use this application to search for books and save ones they have interest in.
